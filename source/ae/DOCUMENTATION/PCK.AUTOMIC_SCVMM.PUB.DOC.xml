================================
System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) forms part of Microsoft's System Center line of virtual machine management and reporting tools, alongside previously established tools such as System Center Operations Manager and System Center Configuration Manager. SCVMM is designed for management of large numbers of Virtual Servers based on Microsoft Virtual Server and Hyper-V.
System Center Virtual Machine Manager enables increased physical server utilization by making possible simple and fast consolidation on virtual infrastructure. VMM enables rapid provisioning of new virtual machines by the administrator and end users using a self-service provisioning tool. VMM also provides the central management console to manage all the building blocks of a virtualized data center.

This Action pack can be used to automate the provisioning of Virtual Machines in SCVMM environment such as follows.
* Virtual Machine Poer Management. E.g. Start/Stop/Resume VM.
* Clone VM, Create VM from template, ReConfigure VM.
* Add Virtual Drive to VM
* Retrieve VM(s)/VM Details/VM Performance Data.
* Managing Checkpoints of VM

=Supported versions=
System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2012
